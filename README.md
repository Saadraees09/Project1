#Amazon Decides Computers Aren't enough

Looking at the increasing success of the movie business over the years, Microsoft has decided to widen its horizons and has decided to set foot in unchartered territory. Microsoft has hired me as their data scientist and trusted me with providing them the best of the data and the best of an analysis I could make about where they should be heading and how.

Created by Saad Raees This file consists of analysis of revenue over the years of roles directors play in generating revenue

WE start by importing all the necessary dictionaries

Then we import our data

Make sure we have the correct DataType for all our columns. We need monetary values to be int in case of any calculations required and we need to clean our data so that we dont have too many unnecessary rows or columns

GRAPHING AND PLOTTING
We will be plotting a joint graph with two bar graphs/regression plot, one showing the change in revenue and the other showing the change in years and between them is a scatter graph corresponding to both values

INSIGHT
As the graph shows, over the decades the movie business has become extremely lucrative. However, even though the revnues have gone up, most movies do not touch top tier of revenue. That slot is mostly reserved for feature films with extremely high budgets. Therefore, the higher the budget, the higher are the chances of generating high revenues.

Directors Role In Generating Revenue¶
IMPORT DATA
For this part of the project, i used external database from Kraggle

UNSTRANGLE AND CLEAN THE DATA

Check for missing values
Drop unecessary columns
Drop the rows with missing values

Plotting the graph¶
Here we pkot the graph to illustrate which director has done how many movies. We do so in assending order so that director with the most amount of movies comes on top and its easier to analyse their worth. We chose the top 30 directors to make it easier sine there were hundreds and we dont need to go through all of them


Directors and the Revenue they generate per movie
Here we can see that James Cameron's movies generate the most revenue, at  760𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑒.𝑇ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐴𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑢𝑝𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑠𝑜𝑓 2 Billion

FINAL CONCLUSION
As someone who has looked at the data veey carefully, I would offer three conclusions

This is a really great time to make movies. The business gets very lucrative with time, even with taking inflation and other factors into account.
Mictosoft should pick a director that has a good amount of movies in their resume. That suggests that studios trust the director enough to invest millions of dollars on their work -Or Microsooft could pick someone as their director, someone who has made movies that have generated innumerable amount of money. James Cameron is one of such examples. However, the budget would automatically have to shoot up with directos like James Cameron getting on board since his movies are extremly high budget.
